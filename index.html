            <p> 
                Hi, I’m Anas, a final-year software engineering student. 
                Since childhood, I’ve loved tinkering with computers. 
            </p> 
            <p> 
                In fact, I love turning ideas into reality through code and design. 
                Whether I'm working on academic or personal projects, 
                my aim is to create effective and innovative solutions. 
                Here, you can explore some of my projects.

            <p> 
                Throughout my journey as an IT student and a passionate tech enthusiast, 
                I’ve had the opportunity to work with diverse technologies. 
                Including low-level programming languages like Assembly and C.
                Multiple web dev frameworks such as node.js, spring boot,
                as well as object-oriented languages such as Java and Python.
            </p>
            <p> 
                While I wouldn’t claim to master every skill, 
                The foundation that I accumulated, my adaptability and my love for the domain are all I need to learn new ones quickly. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In summary, I've explored a wide variety of tools and concepts. After all the IT world is an iceberg.

                            This project was realized in collaboration with a colleague, 
                            it consists of developing a multi-agent system composed of drones who form a sphere in 3D space. 
                            The idea came to us while watching the drone show in the 2024 Paris Olympics.
                            The drone as an entity has only 2 goals: Move to the sphere radius and avoid other drones.
